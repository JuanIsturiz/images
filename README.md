Thank you for joining me in my coding journey!!

### Description

### Setup

1. Run `npm install` so every dependency in the package.json file installs correctly.
2. Create a .env file and pass the correct information for every key (use sample.env as an example).
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application on a local server.

### Preview

Click here for a live preview of [images](https://images-ten-lilac.vercel.app/) deployed at Vercel.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
